- 👋 Hi, I’m @NinaZhang
- 👀 I’m interested in coding apps, coding websites, and AI. My Github is not active since I did most of my work locally and did not push. But I will now try to push more often :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, C++, and JavaScipt
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps and games
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at healtoneforever@gmail.com
